# Firebase Realtime Database: Incorrect Data Setting
This repository demonstrates a common error when setting data in the Firebase Realtime Database and provides a corrected solution.

## Bug Description
The original code incorrectly updates data in the Firebase Realtime Database. This leads to unexpected behavior or errors. The primary issue is an improper use of the `update()` method, resulting in the data not being written correctly or efficiently.

## Solution
The corrected code uses the `update()` method efficiently and properly sets data. This ensures the data is correctly written to the database. The use of transactions helps avoid conflicts with concurrent updates.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install Firebase:
   ```bash
   npm install firebase
   ```
3. Configure your Firebase project.
4. Run the original code (bug.js) and observe the error.
5. Run the corrected code (bugSolution.js) and verify that it works as expected.
